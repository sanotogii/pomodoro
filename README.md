# Progressive Pomodoro Timer

A unique take on the Pomodoro Timer that adapts to your flow state. Unlike traditional Pomodoro apps that force strict breaks, this app understands that sometimes you're in the zone and need to keep going, while other times you need that break.

## Project Status & Direction ðŸŽ¯
Hey! This is my passion project that I'm building at my own pace. While I'm excited to get it out there, I believe in doing things right rather than rushing. Currently moving from Vite to Next.js because:

- Might try to make it public someday, so doing it right from the start
- I want to learn Next.js properly
- Better deployment options when I decide to ship
- Built-in SEO optimization
- Server-side rendering goodness
